Screenshot 1:
A Windows File Explorer window showing a directory listing of multiple image files (likely screenshots) with filenames formatted as timestamps (e.g., "Screenshot 2025-05-09 130405.png"). The layout is in thumbnail view, displaying small previews of each image.

Screenshot 2–7 (Grouped):
Each of these screenshots appears to show parts of a digital form or system interface, possibly a web-based application or internal dashboard. Here’s a breakdown of common elements across them:

User Interface Layout: All images display a table or form with columns such as ID, Name, Email, Phone, etc.

Form Controls: Each includes buttons like “Edit,” “Delete,” or "Save," indicating user interaction features.

Content: Data entries likely represent user or customer records, showing details like names, contact info, and action buttons for editing or deleting.

Color Scheme: Predominantly white background with blue highlights for buttons and headers.

Structure: Clean tabular format, possibly paginated or scrollable with filtering/search options.
